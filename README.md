# Hi there! My name is Jos√©! :star:
I'm a developer who is navigating the mobile world. At the moment I'm studying and working with native Android development with Kotlin. In the future I'm gonna study more of Jetpack Compose, Flutter and also Swift, for Android, multi-platform development and iOS respectively 
## I'm part of the LGBTQIA+ community :rainbow:
I believe it's important to share that, and I want to show that everyone can feel represented within the development area.
